⛽ Fuel Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

Fuel Spam Detection is a Machine Learning system that identifies abnormal fuel consumption in vehicles to detect misuse, theft, or fraudulent fuel records.

📌 Problem Statement

Fuel misuse and theft cause financial losses, inefficiency, and environmental impact. Manual monitoring is slow and unreliable. This system automates detection using ML models.

🎯 Objectives

Detect abnormal fuel usage automatically

Identify mileage drops

Reduce manual monitoring

Improve detection accuracy

💡 Motivation

Rising fuel prices

Increasing fuel theft

Need for automation

Environmental concerns
